            <p>My name is Dawson Hamilton and I am 20 years old. I live in Murray
                Utah and am currently attending the University of Utah coding boot
                camp. In my free time i love to play video games like Rainbow Six Siege.
                I also love to watch video on Youtube and hang out with my freinds from
                high school. I currently work at Cracker Barrel as a server full time
                and hope to leave there as soon as possible. A couple fun facts
                about me is that I am certified to be a fire fighter but dont enjoy
                being a EMT so that is why I am here. also have a daughter that was
                just born Oct. 21st of 2019 and could'nt be happier!
