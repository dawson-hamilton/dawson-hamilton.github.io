this is a site that tells you a bit about me. There are things from when I was a little younger and even things up to this month. 
you will see that I love to play video games like Rainbow Six Siege, Destiny 2, Overwatch... My hope is that after this class I can become
a video game developer myself! I found this assignment to be really fun especially after the last one where I had to hard code all the
CSS before and I really like the outcome. I'm still learning and so there are more things that I would love to add in the future because 
I know that things are getting competitive out there. 

If there are things that you find that you think could be updated in a good way they really email me and I would love to hear ideas. 
I know that I am new to this and I am committed to working on things. 

my email is dawsondhamilton@gmail.com, i try to check regularly so if you email me I will get back ASAP. 

Thanks for reading!
